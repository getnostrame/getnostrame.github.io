# Nostrame

> Nostrame is a free, open-source browser extension that serves as a NIP-07 signer for the Nostr protocol. It allows users to securely sign Nostr events without exposing their private keys to websites.

## What is Nostrame?

Nostrame is a non-custodial key management solution for Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays). It implements the NIP-07 standard, which defines how browser extensions can provide signing capabilities to Nostr web applications.

Instead of pasting your private key (nsec) into every Nostr website, Nostrame keeps your keys encrypted in a local vault. When a website requests a signature, Nostrame prompts you to approve the request and signs the event without ever exposing your private key to the website.

## Key Features

- NIP-07 browser signer for Nostr web applications
- Multiple account management: derive unlimited accounts from a BIP-39 mnemonic seed phrase, or import existing keys separately
- AES-256-GCM encrypted vault with PBKDF2 key derivation (600,000 iterations)
- Per-website and per-event-kind permission controls
- NIP-49 ncryptsec import/export for encrypted key backup
- NIP-65 relay list management
- NIP-04 and NIP-44 encrypted direct message support
- Auto-lock timeout protection
- Zero telemetry - no data collection or external server communication

## How It Works

1. User creates a new mnemonic seed phrase to derive accounts, and/or imports existing keys separately
2. Keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM and stored locally in the browser
3. User visits a Nostr web application that supports NIP-07
4. Website requests a signature via the window.nostr API
5. Nostrame displays a permission prompt to the user
6. If approved, Nostrame signs the event and returns the signature
7. Private keys never leave the extension

## Important: Derived vs Imported Accounts

Nostrame supports two types of accounts:

1. **Derived accounts**: Generated from your mnemonic seed phrase using NIP-06 key derivation. These can be recovered anytime using only the seed phrase.

2. **Imported accounts**: Existing keys (nsec or ncryptsec) added separately. These are NOT linked to your seed phrase and cannot be recovered from it.

If you lose access to your vault, only derived accounts can be restored via the seed phrase. Imported accounts require either your vault password or a vault backup with its backup password. Users should securely store:
- Vault password (for daily use)
- Backup password (to restore from vault backups)
- Seed phrase (to recover derived accounts)

## Security Model

- Private keys exist only in service worker memory when unlocked
- Vault encryption uses AES-256-GCM with authenticated encryption
- Key derivation uses PBKDF2 with 600,000 iterations (OWASP 2023 standard)
- CryptoKeys are non-extractable from the browser
- No external network requests except to user-configured Nostr relays
- Open source code available for audit

## Supported NIPs

- NIP-01: Basic Protocol (Event Signing)
